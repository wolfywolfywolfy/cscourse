				<h3>User experience is...</h3>
				<p>
					There is a focus on <em>(1) Utility, (2) Ease of Use, (3) Effeciency.</em>
					<br>Or in other words, the user's experience when interacting with
					<br>the website in any form.
					<br>
					<br>Some things to wonder about, are: is the user enjoying using
					<br>the website? Are they actually able to accomplish what they 
					<br>need to?
					<br>
					<br>One has to also keep stakeholders in mind...things like: 
					<br>branding, marketing, visual design, and usability are
					<br>very important for stakeholders, so one should keep
					<br>them in mind when programming (they'll make you keep
					<br>them in mind!).

				<h2>User Interface</h2>

				<h3>User Interface is...</h3>
				<p>
					There is a focus on the human's ability to interact with the
					<br>machine. They should enjoy using the website, which means it
					<br>needs to be usable! (No broken screens here!)
					<br>
					<br>Some important aspects to consider are:
				</p> 
				<!--Listing out important values for good User Interface-->
				<ol>
					<li>Clarity</li>
					<li>Concision</li>
					<li>Familiarity</li>
					<li>Responsiveness</li> 
					<li>Consistency</li> 
					<li>Aesthetics</li>
					<li>Efficiency</li>
					<li>Forgiveness</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					(Note: Thanks Wikipedia for this awesome list.)
					<br>
					<br>My favorite listed, is forgiveness. A customer should not be punished
					<br>by clicking the wrong button, and everything being erased.

				<h2>Web Developement</h2>

				<h3>Web Developement is...</h3>
				<p>
					It's not only focused on the looks -- there are also databases and
					<br>servers that need to be taken care of. Not to mention, security!
					<br>
					<br>Tim Berners-Lee was working at CERN when he first thought of 
					<br>linking the idea of hypertext to Transmission Control Protocol with
					<br>Domain Name System. Then the World Wide Web was born, with many
					<br>webpages. :D
